# Frequency Analysis of Words

`lang_frequency.py` contains two functions:

`load_data(filepath)` – takes path to text file and returns its content  
`get_most_frequent_words(text)` – takes string and returns list with ten most frequent words

How to use:
```bash
python3 lang_frequency.py <path to file>
```

Result (10 most frequent words):

```bash
['this', 'list', 'contains', 'ten', 'most', 'frequent', 'words', 'in', 'descending', 'order']
```
